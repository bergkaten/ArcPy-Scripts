# ArcPy-Scripts
A collection of scripts I wrote to improve efficiency in ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro

**ExportAllLayouts.py**
This script exports all the layouts that are in an ArcGIS Pro .aprx file to PDF.

**ListLayerDataSources.py**
These scripts lists the data source for each layer in a map.
The first script lists the data source for each layer in an MXDâ€™s table of contents.
The second script will list the data sources for all layers in all the maps in an ArcGIS Pro .aprx file.

**ReplaceTextWithNewText.py**
These scripts change element text on all the layouts that are in an ArcGIS Pro .aprx file.
The first replaces a whole element text with a new, updated element text.
The second searchs elements that have a specific word/phrase (in this case, "PROJECT:") and if the element has that, it changes specific text within that.
